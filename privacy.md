Automated Collection of Data
When you visit or interact with our Online Services or open our emails, we may obtain certain information by automated means. Autos Tokyo® may use a variety of technologies to collect this information, such as browser cookies, flash cookies, web beacons, mobile device identifiers, server logs, and other technologies. A browser “cookie” is a text file that websites send to a visitor’s computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser. A “web beacon,” also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, links web pages to web servers and their cookies and may be used to transmit information collected through cookies back to a web server. These technologies help us (1) remember your information so you will not have to re-enter it; (2) track and understand how you use and interact with our Online Services and third-party digital services; (3) tailor our Online Services around your preferences; (4) measure the usability of our Online Services; (5) understand the effectiveness of our communications; (6) identify, diagnose and resolve technical issues; and (7) otherwise manage and enhance our Online Services, products and services.

The information we obtain in this manner may include:

Identifiers, such as your device IP address and identifiers associated with your devices and apps;
Online activities, such as dates and times of website visits and app use, content viewed, your search terms, operating system and browser used, mouse clicks, and how you accessed the Online Services;
Geolocation data. When you use our Online Services, we may infer your location via your IP address or other information regarding your network connection. In addition, with your consent, our mobile device-ready website or mobile app (our “Mobile Services”) may collect precise information about the geographic location of your device. If your device is equipped with GPS or can connect with wireless access points or hot spots, or if your device is also a phone that communicates with cell towers or satellites, then your device is able to use these features to determine its precise geographic location. If you have consented using your device’s user interface, the geographic location of your device will be transmitted to our servers in real time any time that our mobile app is running(even if you are not actively using the app or it is minimized on your device). Once you set your device to transmit its location information to us, your device will continue to transmit its location information to us(when it is open) until you set your device to no longer do so. You may at any time opt out from allowing us to have access to your device’s location information by accessing our app’s location settings on your device and setting your device not to share its location with us.
